# LineCounter
This is a simple program that takes a few arguments.
First, give the program the file type you want to search for.
And example would be `go`.
This would count all the files that end with `.go`.
Then, you give it a directory to search, such as `path/to/directory`.
The program will then search the directory, and count every line in every file that has the correct file type.
